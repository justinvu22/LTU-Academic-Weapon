# ML Insights Enhancement Strategy

## Current System Overview
The LTU Academic Weapon ML insights page currently:
- Loads user activity data from IndexedDB
- Processes activities using `useAdaptiveProcessing`, `threatLearner`, and `RecommendationEngine`
- Groups recommendations by category and severity
- Caches results to improve performance
- Displays insights with affected users and suggested actions

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Incorporating User Activity Status
The system can leverage existing status classifications:
- `underReview`: Activities that still need to be assessed
- `concern`: Activities identified as concerning
- `trusted`: Activities verified as legitimate
- `nonConcern`: Activities determined not to pose a risk

#### Implementation Strategies:
- **Supervised Learning Integration**
  - Use `concern` activities as positive training examples
  - Use `trusted` and `nonConcern` as negative examples
  - Create a more robust classification system trained on human-validated data

- **Confidence Score Refinement**
  - Boost confidence when patterns match known `concern` activities
  - Reduce confidence for patterns similar to `trusted`/`nonConcern` activities
  - Implement confidence scaling based on status distribution

- **Feedback Loop System**
  - Update ML models as more activities receive status classifications
  - Implement active learning to prioritize ambiguous cases for review
  - Track model performance improvements over time as feedback accumulates

- **Contextual Baseline Creation**
  - Establish user-specific normal behavior profiles using `trusted` activities
  - Compare new activities against personalized baselines
  - Consider departmental and role-based context for more accurate anomaly detection

- **False Positive Reduction**
  - Analyze `nonConcern` activities to identify common false alarm patterns
  - Refine detection algorithms to avoid similar false positives
  - Implement suppression rules for known benign pattern variations

### 2. Leveraging Manager Actions Data
Available manager actions include:
- `escalated`
- `employeeCounselled`
- `knownGoodActivity`
- `User behaviour addressed`
- `Authorised activity`
- `Escalated for investigation`
- `Isolated event`

#### Implementation Considerations:

- **Signal Quality Assessment**
  - Treat manager actions as informative but potentially fallible indicators
  - Assign confidence weights to different action types based on historical accuracy
  - Develop metrics to evaluate consistency of manager actions

- **Inconsistency Management**
  - Detect when similar activities received different manager actions
  - Flag potential inconsistencies for review before incorporating into ML
  - Implement reconciliation strategies for contradictory signals

- **Semantic Normalization**
  - Group semantically similar actions (e.g., "knownGoodActivity" and "Authorised activity")
  - Create standardized meta-categories to reduce noise from labeling variations
  - Implement NLP techniques to handle free-text action descriptions

- **Multi-signal Correlation**
  - Compare manager actions with user status and activity patterns
  - Use agreement between multiple signals to strengthen confidence
  - Develop ensemble methods that combine different signal sources

- **Bias Detection and Correction**
  - Identify and adjust for systematic biases in manager action application
  - Implement fairness algorithms to ensure equal treatment across departments/roles
  - Use statistical methods to detect and correct for labeling inconsistencies

- **Missing Data Strategy**
  - Develop approaches for activities without manager actions
  - Avoid selection bias from only learning from activities managers chose to act on
  - Implement semi-supervised techniques for partially labeled datasets

### 3. Technical Implementation Plan

1. **Data Preprocessing Enhancement**
   - Add filters to separate activities by status and manager action
   - Normalize inconsistent labels and handle missing values
   - Create weighted training datasets based on label confidence

2. **ML Pipeline Modifications**
   - Extend `RecommendationEngine` to incorporate status and manager action data
   - Implement confidence adjustment based on historical accuracy
   - Add feedback mechanisms to track and improve performance

3. **Algorithm Improvements**
   - Implement ensemble methods that combine multiple signals
   - Add bias detection and correction components
   - Develop active learning modules to prioritize ambiguous cases

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add confidence explanation features showing contributing factors
   - Provide feedback mechanisms for users to rate recommendation accuracy
   - Display improvement metrics showing system learning over time

### 4. Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy Improvements**
  - Track false positive/negative rates before and after enhancements
  - Measure recommendation precision and recall improvements
  - Conduct A/B testing between current and enhanced algorithms

- **Learning Efficiency**
  - Measure how quickly the system improves with new labeled data
  - Track confidence score calibration over time
  - Monitor reduction in contradictory recommendations

- **Operational Impact**
  - Assess reduction in security incidents after implementation
  - Measure time saved for security analysts reviewing alerts
  - Track user satisfaction with recommendation relevance

### 5. Potential Challenges and Mitigations

- **Inconsistent Human Judgments**
  - Challenge: Contradictory status assignments and manager actions
  - Mitigation: Implement consensus algorithms and outlier detection

- **Data Sparsity**
  - Challenge: Limited examples for some status/action combinations
  - Mitigation: Use transfer learning and data augmentation techniques

- **Computational Overhead**
  - Challenge: More complex ML models requiring additional processing
  - Mitigation: Implement tiered processing and selective computation

- **Privacy Considerations**
  - Challenge: More detailed user behavior analysis raising privacy concerns
  - Mitigation: Implement strong anonymization and purpose limitation
