## Charts and Visualizations

### Severity Trend Charts
The system implements adaptive severity trend charts that dynamically adjust to the data's time period:

#### Key Features
- **Adaptive Time Range**: Automatically detects and adapts to the actual time period of uploaded data
- **Smart Window Calculation**:
  - Minimum: 7 days (ensures readable visualization)
  - Maximum: 90 days (prevents performance issues)
  - Adaptive: Uses actual data span when reasonable
- **Severity Categories**:
  - Critical: â‰¥ 2001
  - High: 1500-2000
  - Medium: 1000-1499
  - Low: < 1000

#### Implementation Details
- Located in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and `components/ActivityCharts.tsx`
- Uses centralized helper function `getDataTimeRange()` for consistent date handling
- Implements robust date parsing for multiple formats
- Optimized performance with efficient data structures

## Advanced Analytics

### Data Processing
The system employs sophisticated data processing techniques:

1. **Activity Status Classification**:
   - `underReview`: Activities pending assessment
   - `concern`: Identified concerning activities
   - `trusted`: Verified legitimate activities
   - `nonConcern`: Activities determined not to pose a risk

2. **Manager Action Integration**:
   - Tracks various action types (escalated, employeeCounselled, etc.)
   - Implements semantic normalization for consistent categorization
   - Uses multi-signal correlation for enhanced accuracy

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - False positive/negative rate tracking
   - Recommendation precision and recall
   - Learning efficiency measurements
   - Operational impact assessment

## Machine Learning Components

### Core ML Architecture
The system implements two main ML components:

1. **Anomaly Detection** (`ml/anomalyDetector.ts`):
   - Implements pattern recognition for unusual activities
   - Uses adaptive thresholds based on historical data
   - Incorporates user-specific behavior profiles

2. **Recommendation Engine** (`ml/recommendationEngine.ts`):
   - Generates actionable security insights
   - Groups recommendations by category and severity
   - Implements caching for performance optimization

### ML Enhancement Features

1. **Supervised Learning Integration**:
   - Uses `concern` activities as positive training examples
   - Uses `trusted` and `nonConcern` as negative examples
   - Implements robust classification system

2. **Confidence Score System**:
   - Dynamic confidence adjustment based on pattern matching
   - Historical accuracy consideration
   - Status distribution-based scaling

3. **Feedback Loop System**:
   - Continuous model updates based on new classifications
   - Active learning for ambiguous cases
   - Performance tracking over time

### Technical Implementation

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Status and manager action filtering
   - Label normalization
   - Weighted training dataset creation

2. **ML Pipeline**:
   - Extended `RecommendationEngine` integration
   - Confidence adjustment mechanisms
   - Performance tracking systems

3. **Algorithm Features**:
   - Ensemble methods for multiple signal combination
